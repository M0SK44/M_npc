Description:

This repository contains a set of scripts for implementing and managing interactive NPCs on a FiveM server. The NPCs are configured with different models, animations, and custom 3D texts, and allow the player to perform actions when they get close and press the E key.

Each NPC can have a distinct action function, allowing for custom interactions based on the server's needs. The interactions include displaying 3D text above the NPC, executing specific tasks via custom functions, and customizing the distance at which interactions are triggered.

Features:

Creation and configuration of NPCs with different models and animations.
Implementation of 3D text above NPCs that appears within a configurable distance.
Custom functions for each NPC, triggered when the player is near and presses the E key.
Optimized system to show interactions only when the player is close to the NPC.
Requirements:

FiveM for GTA V servers.
Basic scripting knowledge in Lua to modify interactions or add more NPCs.
How to use:

Place the scripts in your FiveM server.
Customize the NPC data in the config.lua file (models, animations, text, functions).
Load the resource in your server and enjoy custom NPC interactions.
